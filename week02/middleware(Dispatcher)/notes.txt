Dispatcher

The dispatcher object handles each HTTP request received by the server and then decides the order of middleware execution in a cascading form.

To understand Connect better, take a look at the following diagram:


Dispatcher > Application logger > Body parser > Statics middleware > Custom middleware
e.g.
GET/about > next() > next() > next() > res.end()
GET/js/common.js > next() > next() > res.end()

In the next Lesson, you'll create your first Express
application, but Express is based on Connect's approach.
